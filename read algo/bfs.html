      <h1>Breadth First Search Algorithm</h1>
      <p>
        Breadth first search is a graph traversal algorithm that starts
        traversing the graph from root node and explores all the neighbouring
        nodes. Then, it selects the nearest node and explore all the unexplored
        nodes. The algorithm follows the same process for each of the nearest
        node until it finds the goal.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        The algorithm of breadth first search is given below. The algorithm
        starts with examining the node A and all of its neighbours. In the next
        step, the neighbours of the nearest node of A are explored and process
        continues in the further steps. The algorithm explores all neighbours of
        all the nodes and ensures that each node is visited exactly once and no
        node is visited twice.

          It starts at the root and explores all of itâ€™s children in the next
          level(neighbors) before moving to each of the root children, and then,
          it explores the children of the root children, and so on. The
          algorithm uses a queue to perform the BFS.

            <li>
              Add root node to the queue, and mark it as visited(already
              explored).

                <li>
                  For every non-visited child of the current node, do the
                  following:

                    <li>Mark it as visited.</li>
                    <li>Check if it's the goal node, If so, then return it.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, push it to the queue.</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If queue is empty, then goal node was not found!</li>
